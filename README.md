# Spring Security & CORS

## What is it?
This is a simple login page.

## Assignment
Rather than creating a normal MVC with Spring Web, I chose to seperate the backend and the frontend to:
	- Issue an CORS-error forcing me to solve for it.
	- I also decided to setup the backend using Spring Security to add insult to injury.

## Frontend
	- Bootstrap
	- HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery
	- Pages: Login, Register & Successfully Logged In
	- API calls to Server

## Backend
	- Spring Secruity & Oauth2 & JWT
	- ORM (Hibernate)
	- CORS-filter
	- MySQL
